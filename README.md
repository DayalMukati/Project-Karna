# Karna

## Overview

Karna is an Ethereum-based Decentralised Application that enables charities to collect and track their donations directly on the blockchain. The decentralised nature of blockchain allows users to see all of their donations in one place, as well as a transparent view of how their donations were used. As cryptocurrencies are seen as disrupting charity sphere, there is need to rebuild trust so that people can safely donate to charity and see their money used for what it's meant for.

## Features

* Realtime financial transparency in charity donation and distribution.
* Donation can be tracked from any part of the world which ensures trust and supports charity without the fear of the money being used for other reasons.
* Users can also choose to receive a refund if a given cause fails to achieve its goals stated on the platform.

## Workflow

All the organisations will be able to list out some causes for which they are collecting funds as charity. Each cause will also have a final amount to be collected. Donors can donate to these cause(s) listed out by the organisation(s).  If any of the transactions doesn't reach the end cause for any reason, then the smart contract would ensure that the amount is reverted to the donor. Also, all the donors will be able to track their amounts as it goes through the organisations to aid the final cause.

## Impact on society

* People will get motivated to contribute to social causes. Currently, the majority of people have trust issues on the organisation collecting funds, especially in India. This application will prove really useful in raising charity, for example in cases like Kerela Relief Funds, funds for the cause of martyred members of CRPF, etc.
* This will also boost up the spirit of NGOs and social enterprises to contribute to the cause because use of blockchain will ensure that any middleman involved does not alter the actual transaction started by the donor.
